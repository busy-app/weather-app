# Weather

Weather forecast

A JavaScript app for the BUSY Bar, generated from the BUSY JS app template.

## Screens

Three, in a ring: the weather now, the next 24 hours as a graph, and the days after them. An empty screen is skipped.

| Input | |
| --- | --- |
| `ok`, `start` | the next screen |
| encoder | steps through the hours or the days, stopping at either end |

The forecast is fetched on launch and every 15 minutes after.

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_BUSY_ADDR to your device's address
pnpm build
```

The app's id is `app.busy.weather`, set in `src/appmeta/manifest.json`. An id is `<namespace>.<app>`, at most 32 characters, made of letters, digits, dot, dash and underscore. If yours still says `app.example`, change it to your own namespace before publishing.

## Layout

`src/` is the app — everything in it is yours to edit.

```
my-app/
├── src/                          the app
│   ├── main.ts                   the entry point: export default function run()
│   ├── appmeta/
│   │   ├── manifest.json         id, name, version
│   │   ├── settings.json         the settings screen — optional
│   │   ├── icon_front_8x8.png    front icon, 8×8 colour — optional
│   │   └── icon_back_11x11.png   back icon, 11×11 greyscale — optional
│   ├── images/
│   ├── animations/
│   └── sounds/
├── shared/                       app-level helpers, imported as @shared/*
```

Both icons are optional; without them a default is used.

## Resources

Anything in `src/` that isn't a source file is copied into the package. Files in `src/images`, `src/animations` and `src/sounds` keep their folder; everything else is sorted by extension into the same three, and whatever has no match lands in `resources/`.

| Extension | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| `.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.gif` `.bmp` `.webp` `.svg` `.image` `.ico` | `images/` |
| `.anim` `.animation` | `animations/` |
| `.wav` `.snd` `.sng` `.mp3` `.ogg` `.rtttl` | `sounds/` |
| anything else | `resources/` |

A file whose extension disagrees with the folder it sits in is still placed by the folder, with a warning.

Everything the app draws is placed by hand, in screen pixels: each screen builds the display elements it needs with explicit `x`/`y` coordinates and sends them with `displayDraw()` from `@shared/device`. Text widths and line heights come from `src/font.ts`, which carries only the two device fonts this app prints. The screen is 72×16 pixels. The build itself comes from `@busy-app/cli`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build` | builds the package into `dist/` |
| `pnpm build --out <path>` | builds into `<path>` instead |
| `pnpm build --tgz` | also packs the package into a `.tgz` beside it |
| `pnpm build --tgz-only` | packs the `.tgz` and leaves nothing else |
| `pnpm build --no-minify` | readable output, for debugging |
| `pnpm build --bundle` | inlines every module into one `main.js` |
| `pnpm typecheck` | type-checks the app |

## Build output

The package folder is named after the app id:

```
dist/
└── app.busy.weather/
    ├── appmeta/manifest.json
    ├── scripts/main.js
    └── images/ animations/ sounds/ resources/
```

`--tgz` packs that folder into `dist/app.busy.weather.tgz`, with the folder itself at the root of the archive. The release workflow packs its own archive, named with the version as well.

## Manifest

`src/appmeta/manifest.json` carries the app's identity and a couple of knobs:

| Field | |
| --- | --- |
| `format_version` | manifest format, `1` — required |
| `id` | up to 32 characters — required |
| `name` | display name — required |
| `version` | semver, e.g. `1.0.0` — required |
| `description`, `author` | free form, default `""` |
| `heap_size_kib` | memory for the app heap, 1–256, default 32 |
| `debug` | when true, shown only in developer mode, default false |

Raise `heap_size_kib` if the app runs out of memory.

## Node version

The app builds on Node 24 — the version in `.nvmrc` and the range `engines` allows. Node 26 breaks the build and is excluded. With `fnm` or `nvm` installed, `fnm use` / `nvm use` picks the right one up from `.nvmrc`.

## Vite version

`vite` is pinned rather than ranged. Vite 8 builds with rolldown, whose native binding is a separate per-platform package; a release with a missing binding breaks `pnpm build`. Pinning keeps the build reproducible — raise the version deliberately.

## Settings

To give the app a settings screen, add `src/appmeta/settings.json` describing the fields, then read the stored values with `getAppSettings()`:

```ts
import { getAppSettings } from "@shared/device";

const { version, values } = await getAppSettings(manifest.id);
```

`values` is a map of field id to the stored value. If nothing is stored yet, the first read fills in the defaults from the schema. The weather app reads settings once, at startup — restart it to pick up a change.
